💜 FundMe Smart Contract  

🧠 A simple yet powerful "crowdfunding dApp" built with *Solidity × Foundry* —  
because sometimes, trusting code > trusting people 😌  

 ⚙ Tech Stack  
✨ Solidity ^0.8.19  
🧱 Foundry (for testing + deployment)  
⛓ Ethereum Sepolia Testnet  
📡 Chainlink Price Feeds (for USD conversion)  


## 💫 What It Does  
💰 Lets anyone fund ETH  
📊 Tracks who sent how much  
🪙 Converts ETH → USD (thanks to Chainlink magic)  
🔐 Only the contract owner can withdraw (no rug pulls, promise 🤞)  
🧪 Fully tested with Foundry’s cheatcodes (because vibes ≠ bugs)  

 🧰 Quick Commands
